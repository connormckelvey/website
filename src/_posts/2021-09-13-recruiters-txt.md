What does your inbox look like? Because mine looks like this:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/iq4k1UX4XO">pic.twitter.com/iq4k1UX4XO</a></p>&mdash; Connor McKelvey (@cssaddict) <a href="https://twitter.com/cssaddict/status/1437569088730001409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Now, ignore the 99+ unread messages and lack of organization. If you can look past that, you can see my inbox is littered with spam... from recruiters. I get it, recruiters have to grind, but it's not just my email. I get phone calls too, and I've even gotten a cold text message from a recruiter (ðŸ˜Ž included). I didn't consent to this (well, maybe I did when I signed up for LinkedIn). So, I am proposing an initial draft of [recruiters.txt](/recruiters.txt){:target="_blank"}

Inspired by the `robots.txt` file that tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler "can" access on your site, `recruiters.txt` aims to target automated recruitment campaign software (I have no idea what this is actually called). In this initial draft, only two elements are defined:

- Comments (`#`), used for normal code comment-y things
- `No-Contact`, a global declaration that the owner of the website does not want to receive any communications (in any form, phone, email, text) from automated recruiting platforms.

Obviously, simply posting a `recruiters.txt` file won't do anything unless the companies implementing these recruitment platforms decide to respect it. I have no idea what the incentive would be for them to do so, but I'm not sure what the incentive for obeying a `robots.txt` file is either.
